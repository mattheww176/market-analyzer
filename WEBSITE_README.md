## 📚 Understanding Stock Analysis

### Technical Analysis Terms

#### Moving Averages (MA)
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: The average stock price over a specific period, smoothing out price fluctuations to identify trends.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Similar to SMA but gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information.
- **Golden Cross**: When a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, often seen as a bullish signal.
- **Death Cross**: When a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average, often seen as a bearish signal.

#### Support and Resistance
- **Support Level**: A price level where a stock tends to stop falling and may bounce back up, as demand increases at that price.
- **Resistance Level**: A price level where a stock tends to stop rising and may fall back, as selling pressure increases at that price.

#### Volume
- **Trading Volume**: The number of shares traded during a given period. Higher volume often confirms the strength of a price movement.
- **Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**: The average price a stock has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price.

#### Momentum Indicators

- **P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book)**: Compares a company's market value to its book value, showing how much investors pay for each dollar of net assets.
- **Dividend Yield**: Shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price.

#### Financial Health
